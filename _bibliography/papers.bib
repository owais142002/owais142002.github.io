  note      = {This paper presents a novel robotic system designed to tackle the challenges of object grasping and manipulation in warehouse environments. Addressing the complexities of uncertain object positions within shelves, the proposed system autonomously retrieves items from cluttered bins with high efficiency. By integrating advanced algorithms, control mechanisms, and sensor fusion, the robot performs object picking tasks without human intervention, promising significant improvements in warehouse productivity. The system employs dual monocular cameras for 6D object pose estimation and leverages machine-learning techniques to enhance grasping strategies. The results demonstrate the system's potential to revolutionize warehouse operations and advance robotic manipulation technologies.}
