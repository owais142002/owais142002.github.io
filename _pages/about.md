<p>Hi, I’m <b>Owais Ahmed</b> 👋</p>

<p>I hold a <b>Bachelor's degree in Computer and Information Systems Engineering</b> from <b>NED University of Engineering and Technology (NEDUET)</b> in Karachi, Pakistan.</p>

<p>Currently, I am employed as a <b>Software Engineer</b> with a focus on <b><i>AI/ML technologies</i></b>, specializing in <b><i>Computer Vision</i></b>, <b><i>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</i></b>, and <b><i>Large Language Models (LLMs)</i></b>. My work involves developing backend solutions, implementing object detection systems, and enhancing AI-driven applications.</p>

<p>My research interests encompass a wide range of topics within AI and Machine Learning, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Computer Vision</li>
    <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
    <li>Generative AI and Diffusion Models</li>
    <li>AI-driven Automation and Robotics</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to my professional work, I am engaged in independent research focused on large language models and their applications. I am also committed to community service and actively volunteer as a trainer at <b>iCodeGuru</b>, where I teach coding and problem-solving skills to underprivileged students in Pakistan.</p>

<p>I am now seeking opportunities to advance my academic and professional career through further studies and research. My goal is to contribute to the fields of <b><i>computer vision</i></b>, <b><i>natural language processing</i></b>, and <b><i>multimodal learning</i></b>.</p>
