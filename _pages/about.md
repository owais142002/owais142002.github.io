<p>Hi, I’m <b>Hasnain</b> 👋</p>

<p>I hold a <b>Bachelor's degree in Computer and Information Systems Engineering</b> from <b>NED University of Engineering and Technology (NEDUET)</b> in Karachi, Pakistan.</p>

<p>Currently, I am employed as a <b>Machine Learning Engineer</b>, specializing in areas such as <b><i>Generative AI</i></b>, <b><i>Large Language Models (LLMs)</i></b>, and <b><i>Diffusion Models</i></b>.</p>

<p>My research interests include a variety of topics within the realm of AI and Machine Learning, particularly:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Computer Vision</li>
    <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to my professional work, I am engaged in independent research focused on large language models, where I am exploring various challenges and opportunities. I am also committed to community service and actively volunteer as a trainer at <b>ICodeGuru</b>, where I teach underprivileged students in Pakistan in the local language, <i>Urdu</i>.</p>

<p>I am now seeking to further my academic career by pursuing a <b>Graduate program in the United States</b>. My goal is to advance my research and contribute to the fields of <b><i>computer vision</i></b>, <b><i>natural language processing</i></b>, and <b><i>multimodal learning</i></b>.</p>
